        // Quiz Data - ALL 829 QUESTIONS
        const QUIZ_DATA = {"Chapter 6: Operating Systems": [{"id": 1, "question": "You want to transfer files from your computer to a remote server. To do this, you want to connect to a shared directory on the server and copy the files. Which command-line utility will allow you to do this?", "options": ["netstat", "net use", "netshare", "netdom"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The net use command enables you to connect to a shared resource. Depending on the version of Windows you are using, net can be one of the most powerful commands at your disposal. While all Windows versions include a net command, its capabilities differ based on whether it is used on a server or workstation and the version of the operating system. Commonly, net share is used to create shared folders, and net use is used to connect to shared resources. The net user command allows administrators to create and manage user accounts. netstat shows what sockets (IP address plus port) are being used and by which protocols. Net Share is a valid command for managing shared resources, but netshare and netdom are not valid commands."}, {"id": 2, "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a computer that occasionally will not read data from the hard drive. What should they try first?", "options": ["Run Defragment and Optimize Drives.", "Run chkdsk /f at a command prompt.", "Format the hard drive and reinstall the OS.", "Replace the hard drive."], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "It’s possible that the hard drive has some bad sectors, so run chkdsk /f to scan the drive and attempt to repair them. If that doesn’t work, formatting is the second option, and replacing the drive is the third. If your drive is getting read/write errors, having an extra hard drive on hand would be wise."}, {"id": 3, "question": "You have replaced a failed hard drive and need to prepare the new drive for data storage. Which of the following utilities will you use first?", "options": ["format", "chkdsk", "diskpart", "gpupdate"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The diskpart utility lets the user see and manage partitions on the computer’s hard drives. Because of the enormous power it holds, the user must have administrator status to run diskpart. Once a partition is created, the format command will set up the file system on the new volume. The chkdsk command verifies the disk integrity and gpupdate forces group policy changes to take effect immediately."}, {"id": 4, "question": "Which of the following file system types available in Windows Pro for Workstations will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data?", "options": ["NTFS", "ReFS", "ext4", "FAT32"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Resilient File System (ReFS) is a feature available on Windows Pro for Workstations and Windows Enterprise editions. ReFS will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data. New Technology File System (NTFS) has been available on Windows operating systems (OSs) since 1993 and provides file encryption and the ability to use NTFS permissions for security. The fourth extended filesystem (ext4) is a Linux filesys- tem, and File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32) is a legacy filesystem sometimes used for compat- ibility between different OSs, and used on external storage devices like memory cards, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, and hard drives."}, {"id": 5, "question": "You want to use BitLocker to encrypt the company president’s laptop drive, but when you go into the Control Panel to find it, it isn’t there. What Windows 10 edition does this computer have?", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "Windows 10 Home edition does not offer BitLocker as an option. BitLocker is available in the Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions."}, {"id": 6, "question": "Which of the following Windows editions support ReFS? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [2, 3], "explanation": "Resilient File System (ReFS) is a feature available on Windows Pro for Workstations and Windows Enterprise editions. ReFS will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data. As of the fall 2023 update, ReFS use on Pro editions of Windows became limited. To use the full-featured ReFS, you need Pro for Workstations or Enterprise editions.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 7, "question": "You just purchased a new computer that has four CPUs. What edition of Windows will you need, at a minimum, to take advantage of the computer’s processing capability?", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "Windows Pro for Workstations is designed so that users can take advantage of the capabilities of high-end workstations. Windows Home edition can support up to two physical Central Processing Units (CPUs), while Windows Pro for Workstations can support up to four physical processors. Remember that each physical processor has multiple cores. 484     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions"}, {"id": 8, "question": "An employee wants to bring their Windows device to use at work. At work, they will need to log in to a domain. Which reason listed will prohibit the employee from using their device on the domain?", "options": ["Their device has only one processor.", "Their device OS is Windows Home.", "Their device has only 8 GB of RAM.", "Their device must be Windows Enterprise edition."], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Windows Home does not have the capability of joining a domain, so the employee will not be able to use their personal device. Windows Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions are all able to log in to a domain. The number of processors and amount of RAM are irrelevant to the ability to log in to a domain."}, {"id": 9, "question": "One of your technicians needs to use the Task Manager utility. What are two ways they can open Task Manager? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then click Task Manager", "Press Ctrl+Shift+T", "Press Ctrl+Alt+T", "Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc"], "correctAnswers": [0, 3], "explanation": "Task Manager is a powerful tool that works in all versions of Windows, although it has different capabilities in different versions. In Windows 10 and 11, it allows you to shut down nonresponsive applications and view the performance of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, disks, Wi-Fi, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs); as well as to show application usage history, services, and programs launched at startup, users attached to the system, and other useful information.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 10, "question": "You need to configure Internet connections on a Windows workstation. Which tabs of the Internet Options utility in the Control Panel would you use to set the Home page and enable the pop-up blocker?", "options": ["Connections, Security", "General, Security", "General, Privacy", "Connections, Privacy"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The Internet Options utility in the Windows Control Panel has six tabs that allow you to configure how your browser interacts with the Internet. The six tabs are General, Security, Privacy, Content, Connections, Programs, and Advanced. (Note, not all versions of Windows have the Content tab.) The General tab allows you to change the Home page, while the Privacy tab has a Turn on Pop-up Blocker option."}, {"id": 11, "question": "A network connection doesn’t seem to be working as it should. You’ve verified that the cables are good from end to end. Where can you quickly look in the OS to see if there is a problem with the onboard NIC driver?", "options": ["Device Manager", "Programs and Features", "File Explorer Options", "Ease of Access"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "A quick look at Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) is often all you need to troubleshoot a problem with an onboard device. In Device Manager, if the device drivers aren’t installed for the device, you’ll see a yellow exclamation point next to the device name in the list, which signifies that the device is not working properly. Programs and Features enables the user to add, remove, or troubleshoot installed programs (the options will change by program) and add Windows features that are not yet installed. The File Explorer Options utility changes how File Explorer works, such as showing hidden files or extensions and other view options. Ease of Access provides alternative ways to interact with the computer for differently-abled users."}, {"id": 12, "question": "A salesperson in your company travels regularly to foreign countries through different time zones. They have asked you if there is a way to set their Windows 11 PC so that it will always show the time and date for their location. How can this be done? Set Time Automatically. Automatically.", "options": ["In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then choose Date And Time, and select", "In the Control Panel, choose Date and Time, and then select Set Time Zone", "In Windows Settings, choose Date And Time, and then select Synchronize Your Clock.", "In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then  choose Date And Time, and select"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "To always show the time and date correctly for the salesperson’s location, you would need to enable both Set time zone automatically and Set time automatically, as shown in the graphic. Sync now, which synchronizes your clock, would work in the moment but will not automatically change the time and time zone as the salesperson travels."}, {"id": 13, "question": "One of your Windows 10 users has limited eyesight and has asked you to enable voice activation for as many applications as possible. Where can this be done?", "options": ["In the Control Panel, Default Programs", "In Windows Settings, under Privacy, Notifications", "In Windows Settings, under Privacy, Voice Activation", "In the Control Panel, Indexing Options"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The Voice activation window of Privacy settings in Windows Settings will allow the user to turn on microphone access and choose which apps are allowed to use voice activation, even when the device is locked. The choices are slightly different in Windows 11. In Windows Settings, choose Privacy & security, then Speech. The setting is on by default. The Default Programs app of the Control Panel allows you to manage default applications for opening types of files, such as photos or mail by opening those settings in Windows Settings. By choosing Privacy, then Notifications in the Windows Setting, you can allow or deny applica- tions to access your notifications. The Control Panel’s Indexing Options look at words in and metadata of files to provide faster file searches."}, {"id": 14, "question": "You are working with a customer that has a small workgroup (peer-to-peer) network. The employee computers have a program that requires using the X drive. Several computer users need to be able to access this drive, which is actually a shared folder located on the manager’s PC. What can you do to make this drive available for other computers to access as Drive X:\\? (Choose two.) PC), and then click Map Network Drive. Next to Drive:, choose X:, and then navigate to the shared resource. Map Network Drive. user account.", "options": ["On each client computer, open File Explorer, right-click on This PC (or the name of the", "On the manager’s PC, navigate to the shared folder, and then right-click on it and choose", "On the manager’s PC, ensure that each user who will connect to the manager’s PC has a", "On the client computer, create a folder called Drive X, and then, on the manager’s PC,"], "correctAnswers": [0, 2], "explanation": "In a workgroup (peer-to-peer) network, you would first need to ensure that each person who will be using the shared resource has a username and password on the manager’s computer. The resource would then be shared on the manager’s PC, and on each employee’s computer, go into File Explorer, click on This PC, then Map Network Drive and follow the onscreen prompts to map drive X:\\ to that shared resource. Chapter 6: Operating Systems     485", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 15, "question": "You are setting up a network for a very small company. It has a total of 10 computers running a mix of Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 Pro computers, and it has a network-attached printer. What will you use to allow the company to share files and its printer?", "options": ["Domain", "Workgroup", "Homegroup", "Crossover cables"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "To have a domain, you would need a Domain Controller (DC), for which the company would need Windows Server software installed on a network-connected computer. They only have Windows 10 workstations. Homegroups were a networking scheme that shared a computer’s libraries with other people on the same Homegroup, but Homegroups are no longer an option. Crossover cables are not a practical way to share anything among 10 computers. By default, the computers would belong to the workgroup named workgroup. Each computer that is sharing a resource would need to have the user they are sharing with listed on that computer, then the person sharing information could right-click a folder and choose Give access to, then Specific people, and choose with whom they want to share that particular resource. Workgroups are great for small groups of people, but if there are more than 20 or 30 people in the group, you’ll likely want to move up to a Domain Controller and centralized security."}, {"id": 16, "question": "A user’s Windows workstation seems to be using an excessive amount of memory. Which management tool could you use to identify the application that is causing the problem?", "options": ["Performance Monitor", "Computer Management", "Windows Memory Diagnostics", "Processes tab of Task Manager"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "One of Task Manager’s many capabilities is allowing you to see what resources (e.g., memory, Central Processing Unit [CPU], Graphics Processing Unit [GPU], network, and disk) are being used by application, and it allows you to end the process or the entire process tree to free up those resources. Performance Monitor will show resources used but not by application. Computer Management gives access to several other resources but not Task Manager, while Windows Memory Diagnostics is used to test the health of Random Access Memory (RAM) modules."}, {"id": 17, "question": "The CEO will be attending several meetings whose discussions must remain confidential. They want to ensure that the microphone on their Windows 11 PC is not available while they are using certain apps. Where can these settings be configured?", "options": ["In Windows Settings, choose Privacy & Security and then Microphone.", "Device Manager", "Computer Management", "In Windows Settings, choose Personalization."], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In Windows 11 Settings, choosing Privacy & security, then Microphone opens a window that provides granular settings for microphone use, including which apps can use the microphone. Device Manager could be used to disable the microphone, but it would be for all purposes. Computer Management provides access to several tools, but not granular microphone settings. In Windows Settings, Personalization options allow the user to change settings, such as background, colors, and lock screen. In Windows 10, the only difference is that you would choose Privacy, not Privacy & security."}, {"id": 18, "question": "You are manually configuring IPv4 addresses on a computer. The IP address is 200.100. 1.10, and the network number is 200.100.0.0. What is the appropriate subnet mask for this computer?", "options": ["200.100.0.0", "255.255.0.0", "0.0.255.255", "192.168.0.0"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The best way to understand IPv4 addressing is to convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary numbers. This is essentially what the operating system is looking at when deter- mining the network and host portion of an IP address. What we see as dotted decimal notation is seen by the computer as four sets of eight binary bits (either a 1 or a 0). In the subnet mask, a binary 1 indicates that the position of that bit is part of the network number, and a 0 indicates that it is part of the host number. Network numbers always go consecu- tively from left to right with no breaks between. Eight binary bits that are all ones (11111111) equates to 255 in decimal, so the maximum value of a subnet mask’s octet is"}, {"id": 19, "question": "You are configuring a Windows client computer on a network that has a DHCP server and a DNS server attached. From where will the computer get a dynamic IP address and subnet mask? Internet.", "options": ["You will manually configure them in Windows Settings by choosing Personalization.", "You will manually configure them in Windows Settings by choosing Network &", "It will automatically get them from the DHCP server.", "It will automatically get them from the DNS server."], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The default setting for obtaining an IP address is automatic, which means that the computer will look for a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to assign it 486     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions an IP address and subnet mask automatically. No manual configuration is required, but in Windows 11 if you open Windows Settings and click on Network & Internet, then click on Properties of the network connection you want to change, and then click Edit next to IP assignment, you can change the default settings to manual. The process is the same for IPv6, except that you would choose IPv6 instead of IPv4 once you’re on the Edit screen. This can also be done through the Control Panel, by clicking on Network and Sharing Center instead of Network & Internet, then clicking on Change adapter settings and right-clicking on the network connection you want to change. Choose properties, then click on IPv4 and click on configure. Your screen should be similar to the following figure."}, {"id": 20, "question": "You have been told to configure a static IP of 110.110.1.5 for a server. This server will need to be able to access the Internet. Which of the following is not a required setting to configure?", "options": ["Default gateway", "IP address", "Proxy server", "Subnet mask"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "An IP address on a device can either be dynamic or static. In a static IP address, the minimum amount of information that needs to be configured is the IP address, subnet mask, and, if the computer will access the Internet or other networks, a default gateway. A proxy server is an added security measure between a device and the Internet. It is used to translate between protocols and filter out certain types of traffic, such as keeping inappropri- ate websites out and confidential data in the network."}, {"id": 21, "question": "Considering the graphic, what is most likely the IP address of a router?", "options": ["192.168.1.242", "192.168.1.1", "CC-15-2A-CC-3B-31", "255.255.255.0"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Often on a network, especially a smaller one, the router will serve multiple purposes. In this scenario, it is the default gateway, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and the Domain Name System (DNS) server. 192.168.1.1 is the address of the router, gateway, DHCP server, and DNS server. 192.168.1.242 is the local computer’s IP address. CC-15-2A-CC-3B-31 is the Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is embed- ded in the computer’s network interface card (NIC). 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask."}, {"id": 22, "question": "What security feature, common to iOS and iPad OS 16.4.1 or greater and macOS 13.3.1 or greater, automatically provides security updates that are installed on startup before the OS is even active?", "options": ["Sandbox", "File Quarantine", "RSR", "Antivirus"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "Rapid Security Response (RSR) is a feature of new iOS, iPad OS, and macOS systems. It automatically sends targeted fixes for security issues between software updates. For example, if there’s a security update to Safari, it is loaded before the operating system (OS) on startup, or it may be deployed when the system is on, and sometimes will ask the user to restart Safari (but not always). Each RSR will update the OS number with a letter after, such as 16.4.1 (b). RSR is on by default but can be turned off in System Settings, General, Software updates, and Automatic updates (although that’s not advisable!). Sandbox and File Quarantine are part of macOS’s built-in antivirus protection that only requires you keep the system updated, which it will do automatically."}, {"id": 23, "question": "What is the purpose of a subnet mask?", "options": ["Identifies the network portion of an IPv4 address", "Identifies the network portion of an IPv6 address", "Masks (hides) part of the IP address from a hacker", "Masks (hides) the host number from a hacker"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In IPv4 networking, a computer system will compare the subnet mask to the IP address to identify the network and host number of the IP address. IPv6 addresses don’t use a subnet mask. IPv6 addresses consist of eight segments. The first three are a site prefix, the fourth is the subnet ID, and the last four segments are the interface ID, which is essentially the host address. The subnet mask doesn’t hide anything."}, {"id": 24, "question": "You’ve been asked to help with a network for a company that has 50 computers. The company has been using workgroups, but they are getting too difficult to manage. There are an assortment of Windows 11 editions on the computers, including Home, Pro, and Enterprise. What will you do to set up the new network? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Upgrade all the Windows Home PCs to Windows Pro.", "Install a server with Active Directory.", "Downgrade all the Windows 11 Enterprise workstations to Windows 11 Pro.", "Upgrade all the workstations to Windows 11 Enterprise."], "correctAnswers": [0, 1], "explanation": "A network with that many computers (typically more than 10) needs a domain for security management. The Windows 11 Home edition PCs can’t log in to a domain, so they would need to be upgraded to at least the Pro edition. It’s not necessary to downgrade the Windows 11 Enterprise workstations to Windows 11 Pro or upgrade the workstations to Windows 11 Enterprise. Chapter 6: Operating Systems     487", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 25, "question": "You work for a multinational corporation. All the company laptops are configured to use United States English; however, a worker who speaks Bajan (Barbados English) would prefer to see apps and websites in their native language. Is this possible?", "options": ["No, this is not possible.", "Yes. Add English (Barbados) in the Control Panel, Programs and Features utility.", "Yes. Add English (Barbados) in Windows Settings, Time & language, Language section.", "Yes. but it will require reinstalling the OS in Bajan."], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "It is possible to view apps and websites in many languages and dialects. In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then Language & region (see the following graphic). Click Add a language to choose the appropriate language to install if it isn’t already installed, then click Next and install to install it and select the desired language as the preferred language. The language may require downloading a language pack. Icons beside the installed language are used to indicate what is available in that language."}, {"id": 26, "question": "A Windows workstation has an application that appears to be locked up, but the keyboard is responsive in other applications. What system tool can you use to terminate the nonresponsive application?", "options": ["Event Viewer", "Task Manager", "Computer Management", "msconfig.exe"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The Processes tab of Task Manager (taskmgr) will allow you to terminate the non-responsive application. Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) keeps a log of security, application, and system events. Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) gives access to several other resources, but not one that lets you end wayward applications. The msconfig.exe application launches System Configuration, which gives you access to boot configuration settings, running services, and links to other Windows tools."}, {"id": 27, "question": "Which of the following Control Panel utilities enables configuration of a proxy server?", "options": ["Internet Options", "File Explorer Options", "Device Manager", "Security and Maintenance"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In the Control Panel, choose Internet Options and select the Connections tab, then LAN. LAN settings will take you to a window that enables configuration of a proxy server. Proxy server settings can also be configured through Windows Settings, by choosing Network & Internet, then Proxy. The File Explorer Options utility is used to configure how files and folders are viewed and how searches are conducted. Device Manager is a great utility to use when troubleshooting hardware issues, and the Security and Maintenance utility provides a quick way to see if security is configured on the PC and any recent messages."}, {"id": 28, "question": "Considering the following graphic, what do you know about the network configuration of this computer? (Choose two.)", "options": ["The PC is configured to obtain an address dynamically.", "This computer is getting its address from a DHCP server.", "The IPv4 address is a routable address.", "The internal network number is 192.168.1.0."], "correctAnswers": [0, 3], "explanation": "The computer is configured to obtain the address dynamically because the graphic says “Yes” next to Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) enabled. If it was set to obtain an address dynamically but not able to reach the DHCP server, the operating system would have obtained an address using Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) and would have been in the range that begins with 169.254.0.0, so this PC is not being assigned an APIPA address. You don’t know for sure that it is getting its address from the DHCP server because someone could have manually configured it to the IP address shown. Addresses in the 192.168.x.x range are non-routable addresses, meaning that they can only be used internally. To reach the Internet, they would go through a gateway (router) that has Network Address Translation (NAT) enabled. (Essentially all modern routers use NAT.) You know the network number is 192.168.1.0 and the host address is 0.0.0.242 by comparing the IP address to the subnet mask. 488     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 29, "question": "Given the IP address of fe80::308c:fee2:2abc:8337, what do you know about this address? (Choose two.)", "options": ["It is an IPv4 address.", "It is an IPv6 address.", "The subnet mask is 0.", "It is not routable."], "correctAnswers": [1, 3], "explanation": "IPv4 addresses are 32-bits long and consist of four octets, which is a group of eight bits each, separated by a period (.). They are normally presented in dotted decimal notation meaning each group of eight bits is shown as a decimal number less than 256, with a period (.) between each number such as 192.168.1.1. IPv6 addresses are a 128-bit IP address presented as eight segments of four hexadecimal numbers each, separated by a colon (:). Where the hexadecimal number is 0 in any segment, it can be omitted and replaced simply by double colons (::). If consecutive segments are 0, they can all be replaced by a single set of double colons, but only one set of double colons can exist in any given address, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to tell how many sets of 0 are in each part of the IP address. In the example fe80::308c:fee2:dabc:8337, the expanded address would be fe80: 0:0:0:308c:fee2:dabc:8337. The first three segments (48 bits) are the site prefix, and the fourth segment (16 bits) is the subnet ID, also known as private topology or site topology. The site prefix and subnet number together constitute the subnet prefix. The last four segments (64 bits) are the interface ID, also sometimes called a token. The subnet ID in this case would be 0. IPv6 addresses do not have a subnet mask. The value of the first octet, fe80, tells you that this number is a link-local address, an internal number only, not routable.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 30, "question": "You see an IP address with /48 after it.

Meaning that a global unicast address can be reached by any other PC on the Internet, unless you put security measures in place like a firewall. You would likely want a global unicast address on a web server but not on your workstation. Link-local addresses can only be used to communicate with devices that are on the same local link. They will start with fe80 and are assigned in a manner similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses. The IPv6 loopback address is ::1 and is used for testing just like the loopback address in IPv4 (127.0.0.1). A unique local address is akin to an IPv4 private address. Unique local addresses are non-routable, so a computer with only a unique local address and a link-local address (but no global unicast address) would need a router with IPv6 NAT to access the Internet."}, {"id": 32, "question": "You are on a Windows computer that is joined to a workgroup.

What does the workstation need to support to enable it to install Windows this way?", "options": ["Netboot", "Unattended installation", "PXE boot", "USB boot"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "An installation can be started many ways—with a USB drive, a DVD, and so on—and an image and setup files can also be located on and installed from a network. Often called a PXE-initiated boot (for Pre-boot Execution Environment), it allows the workstation involved in the installation to retrieve the files from the network as needed and then configure variables accordingly. Netboot refers to booting a computer from a network drive, not installing an operating system (OS). Unattended installation is an installation type that uses an answer file and little or no interaction from a human. While it’s possible to install Windows from a USB, if you’re using a USB to boot and install an image from a server, the bare metal machine still needs PXE support."}, {"id": 106, "question": "You’re in a secure environment where the workstations are not allowed to have USB ports or DVD drives.

The user can authenticate with their own password instead of the root password, which is a security feature. Another command, visudo, is used to configure exactly what each user can do when they run sudo. The visudo command is not on the CompTIA A+ objectives, but it answers the question of how you would control the access of users who are not root. The su command (i.e., switch user, substitute user, or super user) is used to start another shell on a Linux computer. Without specifying the Chapter 6: Operating Systems     501 username, it’s assumed you are trying to start a shell with super user (or root) authority, and you need the root password to run it.

You can also use an in-place upgrade to refresh an operating system’s files if you’re having difficulties and are unable to resolve them. Make sure you log in with an administra- tor account. Sometimes, the in-place upgrade doesn’t work perfectly and changes something you didn’t want it to change, so be certain that you have a backup before executing the upgrade, preferably as a system image. A clean installation wipes out everything on the hard drive and replaces it with a new operating system (OS). A program-only upgrade isn’t a real term. A multiboot is having two OSs on a computer and choosing which one you want to use at startup. This is cumbersome at best, and the new OS wouldn’t automatically have all your files."}, {"id": 118, "question": "You’re having trouble with a new digitizing pad that the operating system doesn’t seem to be recognizing.

Timeout, on the right of the Boot tab, can be set if you have more than one OS on the hard drive and want time to choose between them. However, a more common option now is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) when more than one OS is needed. The Services tab is where you can stop and start many services, although that can also be done through the services console (services.msc), which has all of the services. The Startup tab only has a link to Task Manager, and the Tools tab is used to provide quick access to other Windows tools. Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) keeps logs of system, application, and security events that can be used for activities, such as detecting attempted unauthorized access to resources. Performance Monitor (perfmon.msc) offers a graphic display of a wide range of counters to track how well hardware, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) drives and Central Processing Units (CPUs), are performing over time.

The who is divided into the file owner, group members, and others (i.e., everyone else). The permissions that can be assigned are read, write, and execute. The command can be quite complicated, but in its basic form, it is chmod [reference][operator][mode] file. As an example, if I want to restrict a user (i.e., the owner) of a file named bogus from writing to that file, the command would be chmod u=r bogus. In the command, u is the reference to the user, = is the operator, and r is the mode. Then, to see the result, type ls -l, as shown in the following figure. Before changing the permission on the file named bogus, running the ls -l command may have shown -rw-rw-r. The first - means it’s a file, not a folder. After that, the three sets of characters (rwx) are as follows: first set for owner, second set for group, and third set for others. As shown in the graphic, after the chmod u=r bogus command runs, the permissions shown for the bogus file when ls -l is run should be -r--rw-r--, showing that the write permission for the owner was removed.

In a business setting, it’s important to have a backup plan, taking into consideration how much data you’re willing to lose and how long it would take to restore said data, if restoring from a backup were needed. The 3-2-1 rule states that you need to have three backups on two different media, and one needs to be offsite. It’s also important to consider having backups that are separate from your main system, so that an infection of the main system won’t infect the backup. Your backup plan should include regularly verifying that the backups are able to be restored, meaning that the backups complete properly, are not corrupted, and your restore plan works. Even emergency medical services have practice runs from time to time to ensure that when a major event happens, they will be ready. You should too. Finally, document, document, document.

Whether a Windows or Linux system, longer or more complex passwords should always be required. There are other ways to keep malware and viruses out as well. Linux has a few advantages on that front. First and foremost, there are numerous people looking at Linux code, which means many people to catch and rectify a vulnerability that could be taken advantage of by viruses and hackers. In Linux, the user and system are more compartmentalized. If malware attacks a user, it will only have access to what that user account has access to, not system files and folders. This means if you must run commands as root, it’s extremely important to, whenever possible, do so using sudo instead of su. The sudo command will run just that command as root, but su opens up an entire new shell as root and a greater vulnerability to attack. If you’re logged in as root, the whole system is vulnerable. Also, hackers know that root is the default name for the system administrator, so you should create another user and disable root so a hacker not only has to guess the password, but the username as well. It’s always good advice to install an antivirus/anti-malware program and update it regularly (preferably automatically). Other Linux security actions are to configure a firewall to filter traffic on unused ports, keep the Linux packages and Kernel updated, remove any software that is no longer being used, and change the /boot directory to “read only” so it can’t be changed. You’ll also want to monitor failed login attempts and lock accounts after a reasonable number of failed logins.

What type of malware has their system been attacked by?", "options": ["Keylogger", "Stalkerware", "SQL injection", "Trojan"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Stalkerware is any software whether a commercial app or a malware that is used to perform surveillance on a person or business for malicious intent, which is stalking. A keylogger records keyboard input for a malicious actor to use later. A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection happens when a poorly written website doesn’t specify limits on Chapter 7: Security     539 what an input field can contain, and that field is used by a malicious actor to insert code into the website. SQL is used to interact with databases, and most websites have databases running on the backend to take orders or capture visitor data for newsletters and such. A Trojan is malware that appears to be a useful program and is unwittingly downloaded by the victim, then often installs a backdoor for a malicious actor to use later for accessing the system."}, {"id": 49, "question": "A security consultant for your company recommended that you begin shredding or burning classified documents before disposing of them.

Dumpsters may contain information that is highly sensitive in nature, and attackers may seek it out by practicing dumpster diving. In high-security and government environments, sensitive papers should be either shredded or burned. Shoulder surfing is literally looking over someone’s shoulder to see passwords or other sensitive information. Social engineering happens anytime someone tries to coerce, threaten, or cajole someone into giving up privileged security information.

What type of security threat could this lead to?", "options": ["Zombie/botnet", "Spoofing", "Non-compliant system", "On-path attack"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "An unauthorized router with a seemingly legitimate configuration is specifically known as an evil twin. Those can lead to on-path attacks, which involve clandestinely placing something (such as a piece of software or a rogue router) between a server and the user, and neither the server’s administrator nor the user is aware of it. The unauthorized device in the middle intercepts data and then sends the information to the server as if nothing is wrong. The unauthorized device software may be recording information for someone to view later, altering it, or in some other way compromising the security of your system and session. A zombie is a computer system that a hacker has a backdoor into and can use to perpetrate attacks, unknown to the computer system’s legitimate user. A botnet is a system of zombie computers engaged in an orchestrated attack on a target. Spoofing occurs when an attacker causes a system or node to appear to be a different one.

The updates are known as definition files and ensure that the antivirus engine will recognize new viruses. However, today’s threat environment requires better tools, such as memory scanning and behavior analysis to catch fileless viruses that hide in memory. Firewalls can be software- or hardware-based and are designed to block or allow network traffic based on certain criteria. Once established, settings are not often changed. Access control lists (ACLs) are tied to objects in a system and are compared to an authenticated user’s informa- tion to determine whether to grant access. These also are seldom changed once they are configured. New Technology File System (NTFS) permissions are part of what creates access control lists. NTFS permissions for an object are granted to a user and can include Full Control, Modify, Read & execute, List Folder Contents, Read, and Write.

It is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack because legitimate users are unable to access resources. The “distributed” part of the name comes from the fact that there was traffic from many infected computers (i.e., zombies), in different locations, attacking your server at the same time, also known as a botnet. Bots, by themselves, are a form of software that runs automatically and autonomously and are not harmful. Botnet, however, has come to be the word used to describe malicious software running on multiple zombies and under the control of a bot-herder, the person perpetrating the attack. Both DoS and DDoS attacks can be launched by botnets, as can many forms of adware, spyware, and spam (via spambots). A brute-force attack uses software to repeatedly try to discover a password. Zero-day attacks happen the same day a vulnerability is discovered. Such attacks are able to evade antivirus/anti-malware programs because antivirus/ anti-malware companies have not had time to respond to the vulnerability yet.

Code is injected into the website and used to gather data from legitimate website users, because their systems don’t see the normally trusted website as a threat. Zero-day attacks happen the same day a vulnerability is discovered. Such attacks are able to evade antivirus programs because antivirus/anti-malware companies have not had time to respond to the vulnerability yet.

Many routers and firewalls will provide content filtering services. In many cases, a reference service is used to block websites, and filters can be implemented to scan emails for prohibited content. Disabling ports stops traffic from entering the network; it does not filter for content. Virtual private network (VPN) access means that a user can access the network remotely just as if they were sitting in the office. Port forwarding/mapping is used when you need traffic on a particular port to go to a particular network device. It is often used for gaming and security cameras."}, {"id": 153, "question": "Your office is in a building with several other companies.

This should be considered a weak form of security because there are still ways, albeit a bit more complicated, to discover the presence of the access point besides the SSID broadcast. Wi-Fi protected access 3 (WPA3) is the most recent secure Wi-Fi encryption standard; however, it has suffered password leaks. The vulnerabilities are expected to be mitigated with future updates. Media access control (MAC) filtering allows or denies access to the network based on the MAC address associated with a network interface card (NIC).

The group policy is then applied to the appropriate organizational unit (OU). Folder redirection allows users’ profile folders to be stored in a more centralized location on the network, rather than on the user’s local device. A profile stored this way is called a roaming profile. The home folder is the specific location where a user’s documents and such are stored, such as \\\\%servername%\\home\\%username%, then usually mapped to drive H:%username%, making it simple for end users. An OU is a management tool that can be used to organize Active Directory resources and can contain users, comput- ers, and other resources.

Proxy servers are known for three things. One, the proxy server can cache the information requested, speeding up subsequent searches. Two, the proxy can act as a filter, blocking content from prohibited websites and blocking sensitive data from leaving the network. Three, the proxy server can modify the requester’s information when passing it to the destination, blocking the sender’s identity and acting as a measure of security; the user can be made anonymous.

Ensuring that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically should be your first step. If it isn’t, then you have found the problem. If it is, then you could ping the IP address using ping -a ipaddress, substituting the dupli- cated IP address for the variable ipaddress in the command. This will return the hostname of the other computer. Every network admin should have a list of computer names and where they are located. You could then ensure that the other computer is also set to obtain an IP address automatically, or if the other device requires a static IP, remove the IP address in question from the available pool of addresses on the DHCP server.

The first thing you should try is rearranging the devices that are using the USB ports. USB hubs have a limit as to how much power they can provide and the number of endpoints that each port can support. A device may have multiple endpoints, and devices that are heavily involved in data transfer may use many more endpoints than other devices. Using a separately powered external hub or docking station means that the port won’t be providing power to the devices, so this may resolve the issue. Disabling the XHCI Mode option in the BIOS/UEFI may help with the resource error but will effectively turn off USB 3.0 and your hubs will behave like 2.0 ports. USB 2.0 ports use fewer resources than USB 3.0 ports. Other troubleshooting options could be to update the chipset drivers for the motherboard and check the power options in the basic input/output system/unified extensible firmware interface (BIOS/UEFI). Make sure any USB controller drivers are updated. If you have plugged and unplugged devices, try going to Device Manager to scan for hardware changes and test the devices again. Also in Device Manager, uninstall all USB controllers and restart the computer. Windows will scan for hardware changes and all the USB controllers that were uninstalled should be reinstalled, which will allow the USB controllers to return an unresponsive port to a working condition."}, {"id": 60, "question": "Your friend has complained that they can’t connect their phone to their Wi-Fi network at home and they’ve used all their cellular data.

Which device should you recommend that the company plug the server into?", "options": ["UPS", "Voltage regulator", "Surge suppressor", "Power strip"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "The best device for power protection is called an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), also known as a battery backup. These devices can be as small as a brick or as large as an entire server rack. Inside the UPS is one or more batteries and fuses. Much like a surge suppressor, a UPS is designed to protect everything that’s plugged into it from power surges. They are also designed to protect against undervoltage events and even complete power failures. Energy is stored in the batteries, and if the power fails, the batteries can power the computer for a period of time long enough, so that the administrator can then safely power it down. Voltage regulators are an electronic component found on some circuit boards.

Some ESD mats have a connector for the ESD strap. This strap and mat connection provides a safe path to ground for stray electrons (static). If you don’t have an ESD mat handy, connecting the strap to a metal part of the case keeps you and the case at the same electrical potential, which will help to prevent you from accidentally damaging components with a jolt of static electricity. Never connect an ESD strap to the power supply, because it contains capacitors that can discharge and injure you.

Remove the evidence from the offending person’s possession, take steps to preserve the data or device, and immediately report the situation through proper channels, whether that’s management or law enforcement. You would not shut down the computer or ask the user to delete the offending content, because doing so might destroy evidence.

For this reason, you should have an electrostatic discharge (ESD) mat in addition to an ESD strap. The mat drains excess charge away from any item coming into contact with it. ESD mats are also sold as mouse/keyboard pads to prevent ESD charges from interfering with the operation of the computer. Many ESD wrist straps can be connected to the mat, thus causing the technician and any equipment in contact with the mat to be at the same electrical potential and eliminating ESD. Magnetic screwdrivers are not a good idea, because they could damage a computer chip if they inadvertently come into contact with it. A dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air. The correct air moisture content for working on computer equipment is about 50 percent.

Each differential backup is larger than the one before, because it includes the cumulative backup of all the changes that have happened since the last full backup. The differential backups are slower to create than incremental backups but restoring them is easier because there are fewer datasets to restore."}, {"id": 77, "question": "Which of the following statements comparing differential and incremental backups are true? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Incremental backups are created faster than differential.", "Differential backups are created faster than incremental.", "Incremental backups are more fault tolerant than differential backups.", "Differential backups are simpler to restore than incremental backups."], "correctAnswers": [0, 3], "explanation": "Incremental backups are created faster over time than differential backups. If each weekday the same number of files were changed, an incremental backup on Wednesday would only take one-third as long as a differential backup, because the differential backup would have Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday’s changes. The Wednesday incremental backup would only have Wednesday’s changes. Differential backups are easier to restore, because you would only restore the last full backup and the most recent differential backup. Incremental backups are less fault tolerant than differential, because there are more possible points of failure in the form of a greater number of backups, which would need to be restored to achieve the same result as a differential backup. Say your procedure is to perform a full backup each Sunday, and daily backups each night, then you discover on Thursday morning that your system crashed.

Rather than do a full backup daily, you have elected to use software that combines incremental backups and a prior full backup to create a new full backup. What type of backup is this?", "options": ["Incremental", "Differential", "Synthetic full", "Grandfather-father-son"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "A full backup that is created from a prior full backup and one or more incremental backups is known as a synthetic full backup. The advantages are that it takes much less time to create a backup because you only need to perform incremental backups, and if you must restore from a backup, it takes less time because you can always have a full backup. Incremental only backs up what has changed since the last incremental or full backup, and differential backs up whatever has changed since the last full backup. Differential backups don’t reset the archive bit, but full backups and incremental backups do. A grandfather-father-son (GFS) backup is a long-term backup where there are father and son backups between the times that the grandfather backups are made. The GFS strategy is often used where a daily backup is called the “son,” the weekly backup is the “father,” and the monthly backup is the “grandfather.” Consider, for example, that you lost all your data on the second Tuesday of the month. If the “father” and “son” backups were incremental, and the “grandfather” is a full backup, to recover all of the data, you would restore the grandfather for the end of the prior month, the first “father” backup, and the “son” backups up to the day the data was lost."}, {"id": 86, "question": "You know that a backup is only good if you can restore from it, so the backups need to be tested periodically to ensure that data can, in fact, be restored from them.

The man command brings up a manual—for example, man grep would show you how to use the grep command. 626     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions"}, {"id": 5, "question": "A security consultant recommends that your secure facility implement biometrics as a form of building access control. Which of the following systems might they be referring to?", "options": ["RFID badges", "Key fobs", "Palm print scanner", "Guards"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "Biometric devices use physical characteristics to identify the user. Biometric systems include fingerprint/palm/hand scanners, retina scanners, and anything else that uses part of your body to identify you. To gain access to resources, you must pass a physical screening process. While it’s true that guards are humans, they are not biometric devices. Radio frequency identification (RFID) badges have information on them that is read by an RFID scanner, and key fobs generate a new code every few seconds to allow access."}, {"id": 6, "question": "You are looking online to find pictures to use in promotional materials that your company wants to make.

Unlike an end-user license agreement (EULA), which legally protects software and other objects, DRM physically protects the information by not allowing copies to be made, printing a watermark on the face of an image or document, or incorporating similar measures to prevent the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted materials. DRM is not as established as licensing agreements are, but you should still respect the property of the owners of digital content."}, {"id": 7, "question": "In which type of security threat will someone try to gain access to a secure area without credentials by following someone else who used their access rights into the secured area?", "options": ["Brute-force", "Shoulder surfing", "Evil twin", "Tailgating"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "Tailgating refers to being so close to someone when they enter a building that you can enter right behind them, without needing to use a key, card, or any other security device. Using access control vestibules, which are devices like small rooms that limit access to one or a few individuals, is a great way to stop tailgating. A brute-force attack attempts to repeatedly guess a password. Shoulder surfing is just like it sounds—someone is looking over your shoulder to gain passwords and logins, and an evil twin is an unauthorized wireless access point that has the same service set identifier (SSID) as a legitimate one."}, {"id": 8, "question": "A management directive requires that you keep hard copies of all your workstations’ system configurations.

The easiest way to install Windows 11 on a Windows 10 computer is through Windows Update in the Settings app. If you have a situation where that’s not possible, you can create Windows 11 installation media and use it to install the operating system (OS). When you launch the installation from within Windows 10, you have three options. The first is Full Upgrade, which will keep Windows settings, drivers, personal files, and apps. The second, Keep Data Only, will keep drivers and personal files but no installed apps or Windows Settings. The third option is a Clean Install, which will wipe out everything on the drive and install a fresh copy of Windows 11."}, {"id": 10, "question": "You are configuring a wireless router for a home office. Which of the following changes will have the least impact on improving the security of the network?", "options": ["Disabling guest access", "Disabling the SSID broadcast", "Configuring WPA3", "Changing the default username and password"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Even if you disable the service set identifier (SSID) broadcast, potential attackers still have many simple tools available to see your wireless network traffic and get the SSID anyway. It is a weak form of security that will keep out only the most casual intruders. Disabling guest access limits who can connect to your network, but if you must have guest access, look for a setting that will isolate the guest network from your network. WPA3 is the best commonly available form of encryption for wireless routers. WPA2 is usually available alongside of WPA3 for networks that are transitioning between WPA2 and WPA3. The router may have Chapter 11: Practice Exam 2 (220-1202)     627 an option that says WPA2/WPA3 or WPA3 transitional, which will allow newer devices to connect using WPA3 and older devices to connect using WPA2.

What will you ask them first?", "options": ["Was it working yesterday?", "What did you do to it?", "Is there a USB drive in one of the USB ports?", "Do you know how to enter UEFI?"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "In troubleshooting, it’s often best to check the simple things first. Ask them if there is a drive in the universal serial bus (USB) port. If the system is set to check there before the hard drive for boot media, then non-bootable media in the port might prevent the system from booting. (Disabling the ability to boot from a USB port is considered a security best practice.) If it wasn’t working yesterday, they likely would have called you yesterday. Never ask an end-user what they did to a system. Even if it is a user error, they probably won’t know they did something wrong, and that question will make them more upset; what you want instead is to make them feel that you’re professional and confident in your ability.

To ensure that the thief does not have access to your data, what should you do?", "options": ["Perform a remote backup.", "Enable full-device encryption.", "Enable BitLocker.", "Perform a remote wipe."], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "The best way to remove data from a device is to perform a remote wipe. Ideally, you have backed up or synced the device before then, or you will lose data. Full-device encryption is a good security practice, but it should have been completed prior to the phone being stolen. BitLocker is a Microsoft Windows feature for full-drive encryption."}, {"id": 15, "question": "You have installed a second hard drive in a Windows workstation. In Disk Management, what type of partition can you create that will allow you to create an unlimited number of logical partitions in it?", "options": ["Extended", "Dynamic", "Logical", "GPT"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "When you create a partition in Windows 10, it will ask if you want to create a master boot record (MBR) or globally unique identifier (GUID) partition table (GPT) partition. GPT is newer and has far more features than MBR. One of those features is that you can create an unlimited number of logical partitions on it. Only the operating system (OS) will limit you; Windows 10 will only allow 128 partitions on one drive. Windows 11 supports only the GPT partition type. In older computer systems, there were primary and extended partitions. There could be a maximum of four partitions, and only one could be extended. Logical drives could be created in an extended partition and were limited to the remaining letters of the alphabet. If there were three primary partitions, they would likely be labeled C, D, and E. An extended partition could hold logical partitions F through Z. Dynamic drives are unique to Windows and support software RAID."}, {"id": 16, "question": "You have some older drives that you intend to donate to a nonprofit organization.

The business has come seeking your advice because the area has frequent power outages and the company has lost important data on its servers as a result. What will you recommend for it to protect against this issue?", "options": ["Surge suppressor.", "Power strip.", "UPS.", "Line conditioner."], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is designed to provide enough power to keep systems running until they can be safely shut down or switched to another power source. The UPS must provide adequate wattage for the devices connected to it as well as sufficient battery capacity. Most also offer protected and unprotected outlets; surge suppression, which protects against power surges; and line conditioning, which improves the quality of power delivered to the device, such as boosting the power when there is a sag on the input side. Power strips only give you a place to plug devices in and turn them all off at once.

What type of security threat will this deter?", "options": ["Shoulder surfing", "Brute-force attack", "Zero-day attack", "Spear phishing"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "A brute-force attack is an attempt to guess passwords until a successful guess occurs. Because of the nature of this attack, it usually occurs over a long time period. To make passwords more difficult to guess, longer is better, with eight characters being the minimum that should be required, or 15 for privileged accounts. Limiting the number of unsuccessful login attempts before lockout may also help thwart this type of attack. Password requirements can be set using the Local Group Policy Editor."}, {"id": 20, "question": "Occasionally when visiting websites using Google Chrome, you receive a pop-up window in front of your browser.

Where do you specify this rule as well as the penalties for not complying with it?", "options": ["APK", "ACL", "ADF", "AUP"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "Acceptable use policies (AUPs) describe how the employees in an organization can use company systems and resources, both software and hardware. This policy should also outline the consequences for misuse. In addition, the policy should address the installation of personal software on company computers and the use of personal hardware such as USB devices. The AUP is often signed during the employee onboarding process and may be part of an employee handbook but is not required to be. An Android package (APK) is a file for installing an Android app, an access control list (ACL) defines who has what permissions on an object, and an automatic document feeder (ADF) sits atop a copier or multifunction device (MFD) to send a stack of papers through, one at a time without user intervention.

Windows 10–11 support a feature called Modern Standby. Modern Standby must also be supported by the hardware. It is not the right answer because it also uses a small amount of power. With Modern Standby, the system will wake from the lowest power to allow short bursts (i.e., milliseconds) of software execution as the system needs them. The system uses just enough power to process background tasks but still preserve battery life.

Jailbreaking is most commonly done with Apple devices because they are more locked down than Android devices are. Jailbreaking an iPhone, for instance, enables the user to install apps that are not approved by Apple. When you open any device up for your own use by cracking software or gaining root access, it also opens your device up more for cybercriminals to perpetrate an attack on it. Jailbreaking and gaining root access often void the warranty on your device. The device may become unstable due to changes made in that mode, and with the warranty voided, you are not likely to receive support in fixing problems.

What will you check next?", "options": ["If the phone is overheating", "How much data is being used", "If they’re having strange pop-ups", "How much space is on the device’s storage"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "iPhones tend to have fewer malware incidents than other mobile devices, so it’s most likely that the smartphone is too full, resulting in the device appearing to run more slowly just as it would with a desktop drive. Overheating, excessive data use, and pop-ups can be signs of a malware infection."}, {"id": 86, "question": "A user has a 32-bit application that they want to use on a 64-bit operating system, and they have asked you if that will work.

A 32-bit application will work on a 64-bit OS, but it won’t take advantage of the 64-bit speed. It will essentially run half as fast as a 64-bit application would. A 32-bit OS only supports 32-bit programs; you can’t run a 64-bit application on a 32-bit OS.

When you have a major change, your headaches will be less if you can gain end-user acceptance before the change occurs. One of the best ways to do this is to involve them in the parts of the planning process that affect them, such as user input screens. Have a meeting and listen to input from the people who will actually be using the system. They may have some insight that you don’t. Also be sure to thoroughly explain why the change is necessary.
